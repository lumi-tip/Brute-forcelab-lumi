# Brute Force Against an FTP Server

In this lab, you will practice exploration techniques, brute force attacks, and privilege escalation in a controlled environment. Your mission is to access an FTP server, discover weak credentials, and obtain two hidden flags. In this lab, you will learn:

- Analysis of misconfigured services (anonymous FTP)
- Use of real password dictionaries
- Execution of brute force attacks
- Privilege escalation in Linux operating systems

## 🌱 How to Start This Lab

Follow these instructions to get started:

1. **Download the virtual machine** from this link:

<onlyfor withbanner="true" permission="get_private_link">
   
```url
  https://storage.googleapis.com/cybersecurity-machines/ftp-4geeks-lab.ova
```

</onlyfor>

2. **Import the machine** into your preferred virtualization software (VirtualBox, VMware, etc.).
3. Start the VM and log in as the user `student:4geeks-lab`.

## 📄 Instructions

- The server has anonymous FTP access enabled.
- There are indications of poor password practices.
- Some system users might be using weak passwords.
- It is your responsibility to investigate and exploit the vulnerable configurations.

1. **Connect as an anonymous user**

    - Use an FTP client to connect with the username `anonymous`.
    - Explore the available files.
    - Pay attention to possible clues.

2. **Perform a brute force attack**

    - Use a tool like `hydra` along with a password dictionary.
    - Your goal is to gain access as certain system users.

3. **Obtain the first flag**

    - Once inside the system as a valid user, check their personal directory.
    - Look for the flag.

4. **Escalate privileges**

    - Discover how to gain administrator (root) permissions using another system user.
    - Retrieve the second flag from a protected location.

## Flag #1

- 📁 Location: in one of the users' directories  
- 🔑 Requires: finding their credentials through brute force

## Flag #2

- 📁 Location: in a restricted system area  
- 🔑 Requires: escalating privileges to gain administrator access

## Recommended Tools

- FTP client (`ftp`)
- `hydra`
- Password dictionary like `rockyou.txt` (available in many security distributions)

**Remember:** there are no magic solutions. Observe, reason, and use the appropriate tools. Knowledge is your best ally.

Happy Hacking!
